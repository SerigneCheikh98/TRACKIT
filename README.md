# Problem/Solution Overview

TRACKIT is a mobile application designed for individuals who are learning to drive and want to enhance their driving skills while monitoring their progress. Users can schedule practice sessions with experienced drivers through the application and decide the topics they want to practice on. Following each lesson, the experienced driver is prompted to complete a form and provide feedback on the student's performance.


# Needfinding



## Domain of interest

We chose “Learning how to drive” as our  domain of interest since it is a versatile topic that touches on safety and everyday’s human behaviour. Improving this field and creating a better experience for individuals learning how to drive results in safer, more responsible drivers on the road. ​

### Interviews


#### 1. **Methodology**

	

For this project we had 2 types of participants:

**Immediate users:**



1. Young adults (aged between 20 and 35 years old) who are learning how to drive to get an Italian driving license. 
2. Young adults who already passed the exam. We interviewed people who studied the theoretical part on their own and others who were enrolled in a driving school.        

                                                                          


    **_Why:_** We chose these users because they went through the process of learning recently and the problems are still fresh in their minds.


**Lead users:**



1. Young adults who failed the exam several times and then passed it. 
2. Young adult foreigners who already have driving license in their home country and are learning to get the Italian driving license

    **_Why:_** These Users are more experienced with the process of learning than immediate users since they did it more than once and know more about the problems students face.​


To look for participants 



1. We went to three different driving schools in Torino:
*  Autoscuola Peschiera
*  Autoscuola Gamma
*  Autoscuola Torino 2 ​
2. We asked our friends for acquaintances who matches our search​

    We met him at ” Autoscuola Torino 2” and scheduled a meeting with him in a coffee shop .


    Francesco did the interview and Cheikh took notes.



#### 3. **How were the interviews conducted**



1. We asked participants if they have time if yes we did the interview on spot otherwise we scheduled meetings with them​. We asked all participants to sign a consent for (for the online interview he sent us a copy of signed consent) before starting the interview.
2. All our interviews were conducted with the presence of 2 members of our team, one did the interview and the other took notes, and all of the interviews were recorded in order to get back to them when some notes were ambiguous or the member taking notes missed a certain idea. The recordings helped a lot for extracting needs from the interviews.
